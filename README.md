# NightLightRGB

This project is based on Adafruit_NeoPixel library. At this moment only the WS2812B driver is used. The example folder and the esp codebase are removed.

With small changes it comes to be a ambient night light. I removed the classic (auto) RGB leds
from the chinese lamp called Star Master and replaced them with WS2812B. The controller is actually an Adruino nano, but it will be replaced by ATtiny85. The actual code is compatible with ATmega328p (Arduino micro).
